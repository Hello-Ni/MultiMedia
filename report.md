# Theory
For audio and music feature extraction in machine learning, we usually take mel-frequency cepstral coefficients(MFCCs) as extraction from song or audio.

But MFCC feature extraction is a way to extract only relevant information from an audio. In other words, the digital format not give us too much information about audio or song.
